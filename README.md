<= Challenge =>
I used the tailwind css for the first time, so there was a learning curve. But, since it was mostly css, things got easy once I got used to the classes.

The Footer was a little tricky. I could have been a little redundant with the code over there.

<= PS =>
I have changed the tailwind.config.js. There are only 2 breakpoints for now. Please test within those screen sizes.

<= Time Taken =>
5 hours!

<= Personal Outlook =>
I work mostly on the architecture of any project. From the past 5 months, I have grown very strong as a frontend Software Architect.

I am very good at mathematics, which makes me very good at building complex with architecture with the least possible time complexity.
